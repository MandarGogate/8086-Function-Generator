#Function Generator using X86 Microprocessor
## Variable-Frequency-Waveform-Generator
EEE/INSTR F241 – Microprocessor Programming &amp; Interfacing BITS- Pilani Goa Campus

##DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:-
1. This system is used to generate a Sine/Triangular/Square waveform
2. Frequenciesrangingfrom10Hzto99KHz.
3. Voltage is between 0-10V.
4. Desired frequency can be entered by pressing buttons provided on the keypad.
For eg. To Generate a Square Waveform of Frequency 83.25 KHz the user has to press Square, Followed by 10K Key- 8 Times, 1K Key – 3 Times, 100 Key –2 Times 10 Key- 5 Times.
5. When generate is pressed then the selected waveform of that frequency will be generated. If the user wants to change the waveform, he just has to press the desired Button
